// This file is for future routes related to recording workouts to a log book of some kind.  Users should be able to enter the type of workout they did, categorize it (i.e. cardio, aerobic, weight lifting, strength training, etc).

// For weight training exercises, there should be a way to input weight lifted, and reps completed.  Should allow for variations for each set (I.E. 1 set of 15 at 100lbs, 1 set of 15 of 120 lbs, 1 set of 8 at 150 lbs, 1 set of 30 at 50lbs, for a total of 4 sets for that workout).  Checkbox for whether or not this was a PR (for both cardio and strength workouts).

// @route   POST api/workouts/me
// @desc    Record the workouts completed.
// @access  Private (Auth middleware)
